"""MCP output budget (ticket mcp-output-budget-audit): every read tool stays ≤ ~20k
tokens (80k chars on the serialized envelope, safety margin under the 25k-token
directory line) against a REALISTIC fixture — two flagship example projects plus
one persona with 16 weeks of lived memory, real-sized corpora, a survey with
responses, a usability session, assets, a walkthrough script, a plan run and chats.

The audit is exhaustive by construction: every `readOnlyHint` tool in the
annotations registry must be either CALLED (args in _tool_args) or SKIPPED with a
written reason (_SKIPPED) — an unclassified new tool fails the test, so no tool
ever ships unaudited. One read-shaped writing tool the ticket names
(export_synthesis returns the document inline for format="md") is audited as an
extra. Persona memory is now a pure read; exporting it is a separate bounded write.

Fixed offenders pinned here (sizes from the audit run on this fixture):
- get_corpus include_chunks=True   306k -> ~12k  (chunk pagination + in-band note)
- get_calendar_period (month/year) 227k -> <60k  (summary rows + cap + note;
  detail="full" keeps the old shape for Python callers)
- get_timeline                     104k -> <60k  (newest-N caps + totals + note)
