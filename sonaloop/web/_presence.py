"""Project presence CONTRACT — nothing project-scoped is invisible on the DEFAULT project page
(tracker: sonaloop/project-presence-contract, user decision 2026-06-10).

Two declared layers, enforced by the gate test (tests/test_project_presence_contract.py, the
house pattern of the chip contract / LOC budget / i18n parity):

  - REGISTRY: every core artifact kind that carries a `project_id` declares WHERE it shows on
    the default project page — one of OUTLINE_ROW, NESTED_CHILD, SECTION_WITH_HEADER_CHIP, or
    (later, by explicit user decision only) HIDDEN_WITH_REASON. ALLOWED_HIDDEN is EMPTY: right
    now NO kind may register hidden.
  - LIST_SOURCES: every `list_*(project_id=…)` function on the services/storage surface maps to
    its registered kind — or to an explicit NotAnArtifact sentinel naming WHY that listing
    carries no artifact kind (so the mapping stays an inventory, not a loophole). The gate
    enumerates the surface (project_scoped_list_functions) and fails on an unmapped function:
    a new project-scoped artifact kind cannot ship without declaring where it shows.

presence_violations() is the single check the gate asserts empty.

Since UX P2 (spec/ux-contract.md §3.4) every kind is an OUTLINE ROW in its phase context — the
tier-3 appendix sections + header jump-chips retired (the row items are built by
web/_graph_outline_extras). The module keeps the SHARED pill/row renderers (survey lifecycle,
decision + hypothesis status pills, asset rows) used by the outline chips, the detail pages and the
cross-project list pages alike."""
