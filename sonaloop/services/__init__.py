"""Service layer (split out of the former monolithic sonaloop/services.py).

Behavior-preserving package split: every previously-public name on
`sonaloop.services` is still importable as `services.<name>` and via
`from sonaloop.services import <name>`. The original file's bare-name
cross-calls are preserved verbatim in the submodules; this __init__ binds the
needed cross-module names into each submodule's globals after all submodules are
imported, so those LOAD_GLOBAL lookups resolve exactly as before — without
introducing import cycles.

The host-authored simulation cluster (the simulate_day builder + record_day /
record_month_bundle) lives together in ._simulation; the day's text is authored
by the MCP host and passed in as day_plan/activities (no in-process generation).

# now decoupled at the source, so no fan-out (and no custom module __setattr__) is
# needed:
#   * ROOT — the repo root. Submodules read it dynamically as `config.ROOT`
#     (single source in sonaloop/config.py), so a test that does
#     `monkeypatch.setattr(config, "ROOT", tmp)` redirects every service at once.
#   * function overrides (e.g. export_synthesis_pptx / export_synthesis_pdf) —
#     patch the submodule that CALLS the bare name
#     (`sonaloop.services._synthesis_pptx.<fn>`), the same namespace the call
#     resolves its globals from.
# _SUBMODULES stays as a module attribute for the presence gate and other callers.
